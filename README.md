# User Tutorial / How to use

## Using the Bookshelf

####	Start by creating a book or selecting one you've previously created. Once you have a book selected, you will see a sidebar 
appear on the left which allows you to navigate to other areas of the website to start creating. With a selected book, you can either 
right-click or press the 3 dots in the top right of that book to bring up an edit menu. From here you have the options of renaming the
book, changing the description, or deleting it along with all of the book contents.**


## Creating Items

####	On any of the item pages (which are the Characters, Groups, Events, Places, and Concepts icon on the sidebar) you're greeted with 
an area to make a new item. Click the add button in the bottom right and give your item a name! When the item is selected, you will have an
additional menu pop up to the right with the home section highlighted. To add in a description about the item, click the edit button in the 
bottom right which will bring up a text editor that allows you write whatever information you want. When you're done writing just hit save.


## Making Relations
 
####	Relationships between items make for easy navigation across the website. This should be utilized for items in which there is some 
connection between the two, So that a quick reference can be made. To make a relation click on one of the item menus associated sections. EX:
Characters to make a relationship with a character. This will show all relationships that item has, and by hovering over a relationship you can see
the type of relation you defined. Clicking it will navigate you to that other item. However, while editing (when the edit button is selected) you will
see all items of that type both relationships and non-relationships. By selecting a non-relationship, an add button appears which allows a quick 
relation to be made. On the other hand, selecting an existing relation displays a delete and rename button. Note: Making a relationship is now 2-way 
so you will have to go define a relation on the other item if you want such a thing.


## The Attribute List

####	On the home section for an item, you may notice the attribute list. Attributes are reusable info points you can use across all items. Simple enter 
edit mode and click Edit Attribute Groups to get started. From here you will get a menu with all attributes groups on the left and all associated attributes
on the right. On the left side, you can create, select, rename, or delete a group. If you have one selected, then on the right you can do the same things for
attributes. Remember these are created for an entire book, so all items share these same attribute groups and attributes. To populate a specific item, check 
the checkbox of the attribute and provide a value to be placed in the table. You can select as many or as little attributes to give an item. At any point you 
can remove an attribute from the table by deselecting the checkbox. To edit the value of an attribute, enter edit mode on the home section and you will see the
value box turn purple. From there just type in the updated information.


## Writing in the Text Editor

####	Our text editor provides various components which are very important to understand. The one thing that makes this particular text editor stand out is that 
whenever an item's name is mentioned, that text will be high-lighted purple in the editor. When clicked, information about that item will be shown on the page next to
the editor. Similarly, the @ symbol in our text editor is very important. This symbol will pull up a menu containing all of the names of the items created in the book. 
he editor also supports key-binds, such as ctrl+b to bold text, ctrl + c to copy, etc. Everything written inside of the text editor MUST be saved manually, however, if 
you make changes to the text of a chapter and navigate to another chapter than it's contents are automatically saved and there is no need to manually save. A tool bar 
exists which allows users to undo, redo, bold text and more. A text editor side bar exists which allows users to create new chapters to their writings. Users can add 
chapters, remove chapters and swap the position of chapters by using the up and down arrows. Lastly, users can click on the dropdown menu to access the page contents 
hich will show all headings inside of a page. When these headings are clicked the user will be instantly navigate to that content in the editor.


## Timelining Events

####	The timeline page is meant to help users visualize the sequence of events which occur within a story. To place an event onto the timeline, a user must click on an event 
from the "Nontimeline events" side bar. With an event selected, a user can click on the timeline to anchor that event to the visualization. The user can than select the starting, 
or ending position of the event by clicking on the timeline a second time. When an event was anchored to the timeline page, an indicator will  be shown on the timeline page as to 
what the event will look like when placed. Users can place as many events as needed. If the user has ran out of space on their timeline, they can click on right arrow button located 
directly below the timeline to move to a "future" position within the timeline. Users can click on the left arrow button to navigate "backwards" within a timeline, if a backwards 
timeline exists. Lastly, if users want to mark or denote segments of time with dates or phases of a writing, they can click on the "Add Label" button. The user will need to click on 
the timeline and enter the text they want that label to hold on the timeline.


## Event Groupings

####	An event grouping is meant to be a "marking" that is used to shown a relationship between multiple events. To create an event grouping you will click on the dropdown menu on the 
sidebar than click on the event groupings tab. Once the event groupings sidebar you can select a color and provide a title that describes the relationship between events on the timeline. 
With those two pieces of information defined, you can create a new event groups. Once you have event groups defined we can now assign them to events within the timeline. To assign an event 
group to a specific event, click on the circle on the desired event. A menu will open and will display the color of the event groupings. Click on the color you want to assign that group 
to the event.
