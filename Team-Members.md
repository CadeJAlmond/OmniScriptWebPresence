A full-stack engineer with a bs in Software Development GPA : 3.6+ and a high honors associates degree of 
science GPA : 3.8+. I love creating highly scalable and ingenuitive applications that help others. I love creating
scalable software systems using microservices, dockerization and kubernetes. I enjoy deploying and ultilizing AWS 
services like EC2, elastic beanStalk, EKS, s3, amplify, and lambdas. I am looking forward to learning more about
data-science topics such as reinforcement and deep learning. I am familar in working with React, FastAPI, Node JS,
Redux, C++, Java and GoLang. I look forward to learning more interesting topics in CS and developing awesome 
software !

I am a software engineer with a BS in Computer Science with a minor in Animation. My main interests are in web 
development and programming creative applications. With a bit of innovation, artistic vision, and problem-solving, 
anything is achievable!

I am a Computer Science major at the University of Utah. My interests range from Networks to Security, with my 
favorite topic being Database Design. I have experience in full stack development, with preferences to backend processes, 
including data storage and algorithm design. I prefer to use high level languages such as C# and Java, as I have strong 
abilities in object-oriented programming. Outside of the tech field, I have interests in the natural sciences, specifically 
biology and chemistry. I hope to one day design my own video game from the ground up and have been independently learning 
how to 3D model and use game engines to create basic functionality.

I am a (very soon to be) graduate with a B.S. degree in Computer Science from the University of Utah. I really enjoy solving
the interesting and dynamic problems you encounter during coding, and enjoy working in any object-oriented programming language. 
I am particularly proficient with C# and backend web development through .NET, or programming for games through the Unity engine, 
but I have experience in Java, C, C++, Python, and frontend styling or html work. Outside of my professional interests I have a 
passion for video games, and programming I do in my free time is primarily experiments in game making.
